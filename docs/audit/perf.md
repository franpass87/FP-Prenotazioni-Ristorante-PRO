# Performance Review â€“ Phase 5

## Goals
- Reduce redundant option parsing when resolving meal availability.
- Prime caches for downstream availability checks used in booking flows.

## Changes Implemented
- Added a shared runtime/object cache bucket for derived meal settings to avoid repeated option parsing and lookups within a request.
- Cached the filtered active meals list in both in-memory and persistent object caches, automatically invalidated on settings updates.
- Built an indexed meal lookup map so repeated `rbf_get_meal_config()` calls become O(1).

## Verification
- Confirmed lint-level PHP syntax checks pass for the touched utilities module.
- Manual review of booking flow helpers to ensure new caching paths keep existing sanitization and defaults intact.

## Next Steps
- Profile AJAX calendar queries after caching to ensure transients are correctly leveraged.
- Investigate additional hotspots surfaced by PHPStan level-6 findings once they are triaged.
