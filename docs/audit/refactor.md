# Phase 7 â€“ Refactoring

## Overview
- Introduced a dedicated `RBF_Module_Loader` to orchestrate plugin modules with context-aware loading across shared, admin, frontend, and WP-CLI scopes.
- Replaced the monolithic `rbf_load_modules()` bootstrap with the reusable loader helper so modules are required once and only when relevant to the current request.
- Added extension points (`rbf_module_loader_default_config`, `rbf_module_loader_initialized`, `rbf_module_loader_dynamic_modules`) for future service extraction and third-party integrations without touching the bootstrap file.

## Impact
- Prevents redundant `require_once` calls for utilities and runtime logger bootstrap while keeping backward compatibility with existing procedural modules.
- Ensures CLI contexts no longer load frontend-only assets, reducing memory footprint for automation tasks.
- Establishes a central location for future module reorganizations and migration to class-based architecture.

## Follow-up
- Migrate remaining procedural modules into service classes that can be registered with the loader as factories instead of direct file includes.
- Add automated tests around the loader hooks as part of the upcoming CI phase.
