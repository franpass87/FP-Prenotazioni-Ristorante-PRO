# Security Hardening (Phase 4)

## Overview
The security review focused on privileged AJAX workflows that expose booking data to authenticated administrators. We hardened input validation, enforced stricter capability checks, and added reusable sanitization helpers to guard against malicious payloads.

## Remediations
- **Calendar & Staff Feed Endpoints**: Added centralized date-range validation before querying bookings. Requests exceeding sane bounds or providing malformed dates are rejected with HTTP 400 responses to prevent heavy queries and injection attempts.
- **Booking Update Endpoint**: Normalized booking IDs, sanitized nested payloads with dedicated name/phone handlers, validated email formats, and enforced canonical booking statuses via a shared helper. Empty fields now clear meta safely while preserving translated fallbacks for titles.
- **Utility Helpers**: Introduced `rbf_normalize_iso_date()`, `rbf_validate_date_range()`, and `rbf_normalize_booking_status()` to provide consistent sanitization across future entry points.

## Next Steps
- Extend the new helpers to public-facing AJAX handlers that accept date ranges to guarantee consistent enforcement.
- Leverage automated tests around the booking update workflow to cover regressions for capacity recalculation and meta persistence.
