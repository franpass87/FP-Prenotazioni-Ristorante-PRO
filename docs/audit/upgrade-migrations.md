# Upgrade & Migrations â€“ Phase 9

## Summary
- Introduced a centralized `RBF_Upgrade_Manager` that compares the stored plugin version against `RBF_VERSION`, runs pending migrations, and finalizes upgrades by clearing caches, refreshing the build signature, and flushing OPcache.
- Added database helpers to detect and synchronize the dedicated booking status lookup table while keeping multisite-aware option access intact.
- Created the `{prefix}rbf_booking_status` table and an automated backfill that normalizes legacy post-meta values for existing bookings.
- Ensured booking status writes mirror into the new table and adjusted the auto-complete cron query to leverage the shared SQL source helper regardless of storage backend.

## Migration Details
| Target Version | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1.7.0 | Create the booking status table via `dbDelta`, backfill existing bookings in batches of 200, reschedule the status maintenance cron if missing, and refresh cached SQL joins. |

## Cache & Deployment Notes
- `rbf_clear_transients()` now runs alongside OPcache invalidation (`rbf_flush_plugin_opcache()`) during upgrade finalization to avoid stale runtime state after deploys.
- The build signature stored in `rbf_plugin_build_signature` is refreshed whenever plugin files change, even if no version bump occurred, keeping asset versioning aligned.

## Follow-up Considerations
- Monitor the booking status backfill on large datasets; chunk size can be adjusted via a dedicated filter if future scaling requires it.
- Extend automated tests to cover upgrade scenarios (e.g., verifying table creation and status synchronization) once the PHPUnit harness is expanded with WordPress integration tests.
